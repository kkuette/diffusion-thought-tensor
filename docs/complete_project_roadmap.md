# Adaptive Thought Tensor Architecture - Complete Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview

A novel neural architecture that maintains persistent, self-organizing thought tensors using diffusion models as the primary thought generator. The system features adaptive dimensional complexity, unified meta-cognitive growth, and emergent hierarchical reasoning capabilities.
