# Thought Tensor LLM Module - Project Plan

## Core Concept

A novel neural module that maintains persistent n-dimensional "thought tensors" across LLM forward passes, enabling continuous cognitive state and emergent symbolic reasoning.

**Key Innovation:** The LLM outputs both text and a thought tensor on each pass. This tensor becomes input for the next forward pass, creating a persistent working memory that evolves and compresses over time.

## Architecture Overview

```
Input: [Text Tokens] + [Thought Tensor(n-D)]
    ↓
LLM Processing + Attention Mechanism
    ↓
Output: [Text Tokens] + [New Thought Tensor((n-1)-D)]
    ↓
New Thought Tensor → Input for next pass
```

### Core Constraints
- **Dimensionality Rule:** `input_dim ≥ output_dim + 1`
- **Purpose:** Forces compression/abstraction and adds temporal dimension
- **Resolution:** Higher tensor sizes = deeper thoughts, more compute cost

## Implementation Strategy (RTX 3090 Local Setup)

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Prototype (FREE!)
**Goal:** Prove the concept works at all

**Setup:**
- RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) - perfect for this project!
- Start with GPT-2 medium (355M params) or even GPT-2 large (774M)
- Can handle larger thought tensors and batch sizes
- Sequence length up to 512+ tokens easily

**Initial Experiment:**
```python
# Much more ambitious starting point with 3090
thought_tensor = torch.randn(16, 16, 8)  # 4D→3D possible
# Or even: torch.randn(32, 32, 16, 4)  # 5D→4D
# Batch size = 4-8, sequence length = 512
```

**What the 3090 enables:**
- **Larger models:** GPT-2 large (774M) or even small GPT-J (1.3B)
- **Higher resolution tensors:** 32x32x16 instead of 8x8x4
- **Longer sequences:** Full conversations, not just snippets  
- **Batch experimentation:** Multiple thought states simultaneously
- **Real-time iteration:** No waiting for cloud instances

**Success Metrics:**
- Tensor values change meaningfully across passes
- Some correlation between tensor state and text output
- System doesn't collapse to zeros or explode

### Phase 2: Pattern Discovery (FREE!)
**Goal:** Identify emergent behaviors and structures

**Experiments:**
- Track tensor evolution over 1000+ forward passes
- Test high-resolution tensors (32x32, 64x64)
- Run multiple experiments in parallel
- Compare different base models (GPT-2 variants, maybe DistilGPT)
- Long conversation experiments (multi-hour tensor evolution)

**Data Collection:**
- Log tensor states every 10 passes
- Create visualizations of tensor evolution
- Test on different conversation types (math, creative, logical)

### Phase 3: Advanced Experiments (FREE!)
**Goal:** Push the boundaries of what's possible

**Now you can try:**
- **Multiple thought streams:** Different tensor "personalities"
- **Tensor transfer:** Load saved states between sessions
- **Fine-tuning:** Actually train the thought module properly
- **Comparative studies:** Multiple architectures running simultaneously
- **Real conversations:** Full-length interactions with persistent memory

## Technical Starting Points

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fork a simple transformer implementation** (nanoGPT, minGPT)
2. **Add tensor input/output heads** to the model
3. **Implement basic attention** between text tokens and tensor elements
4. **Create tensor compression layer** (start with simple linear projection)

### Key Technical Questions to Explore
- **Attention Design:** How should text tokens attend to tensor elements?
- **Compression Method:** Linear layers vs convolution vs learned attention?
- **Initialization:** Random, structured priors, or pre-trained embeddings?
- **Training Signal:** What loss function teaches good thought representations?

## Budget Breakdown

| Phase | Compute Cost | Time Investment | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 | FREE (local) | 1-2 weeks | Proof of concept |
| Phase 2 | FREE (local) | 2-3 weeks | Pattern discovery |
| Phase 3 | FREE (local) | 3-4 weeks | Advanced experiments |
| **Total** | **~$0** | **6-9 weeks** | **Full exploration** |

**Optional additions:**
- Weights & Biases Pro ($20/month) for advanced experiment tracking
- Additional storage for tensor state archives
- Power costs (negligible)

## Expected Discoveries

### Likely Outcomes
- Tensor develops spatial/temporal structure
- Different regions specialize for different reasoning types
- Emergent compression strategies
- Novel representational patterns unlike human language

### Potential Breakthroughs
- Self-organizing symbolic language in tensor space
- Transfer of "thinking styles" between models
- Long-term cognitive development beyond single conversations
- New forms of interpretable AI reasoning

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Tensor collapse:** Monitor for degenerate solutions
- **Computational explosion:** Start small, scale carefully
- **Training instability:** Use gradient clipping, careful learning rates

### Budget Risks
- **Cost overruns:** Set hard spending limits per phase
- **Inefficient compute:** Use spot instances, monitor usage
- **Scope creep:** Stick to minimal viable experiments initially

## Next Actions

1. **Set up development environment** (local + cloud)
2. **Implement minimal prototype** (1-2 weeks)
3. **Run first experiments** (visualize tensor evolution)
4. **Document everything** (this might be more important than the results)
5. **Share findings** (even negative results are valuable)

*Remember: The goal isn't to build a production system, but to explore whether thought tensors can emerge meaningful cognitive behaviors. Document everything - failed experiments are often as valuable as successful ones.*
