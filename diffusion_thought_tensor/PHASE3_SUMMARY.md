   - Comprehensive snapshot system

2. **Advanced Coherence Metrics** (`analysis/coherence_metrics.py`)
   - Multi-scale coherence analysis (global, local, temporal)
   - Structural integrity measurement
   - Emergent property detection (dimensionality, fractals, symmetries)
   - Network analysis of thought relationships

3. **Trajectory Visualization** (`analysis/trajectory_visualizer.py`)
   - 3D trajectory plotting using PCA projection
   - Flow field visualization showing evolution vectors
   - Interactive visualizations with Plotly
